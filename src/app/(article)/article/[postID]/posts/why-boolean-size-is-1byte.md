# Why boolean size is 1 byte?

The article answers why bool data type consist of 8 bit instead of single bit. The question maybe look simple to answer, but there is too much technical details about it. As most information given in here is based on my knowledge, research and is not guaranteed to be 100% perfect. If you see an mistake, I would be very happy if you would report it to me. The bool data type only refers to bool data type exists in C/C++ languages and only C language implementations covered in the examples.

Before we start, I want you to reverse our question to "Why 1 byte boolean is more efficent?" because if we actually look at the old computer history, throughout history, many problems have come and gone or still continues. If the boolean, one of the smallest building blocks of software, had been poorly designed, that would be ridiculous. That means that we lack of knowledge, making boolean data type 1 bit would be more insufficent and problematic. Let's see why.
