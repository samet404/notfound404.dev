    {/* # My perspective about tech

    If you are coming from the home page of my website, you know that I like to learn new languages, tools and frameworks. I thought that maybe it would be good If I list down all of my thoughts about the current code ecosystem, my decisions about choosing right technology for right solution.

    I think the main problem about writing code is not writing the actual code rather deciding what to build. Making wrong desicions not only creates short-term problems, as time continues it also creates long-term problems as you scale up. It's also reminds us that learning how to learn is the most important thing.

    ## Android

    ## Desktop

    ## Games

    ## Web

    Before starting to tell about my choices when building web application, I wanna ask you a question, isn't that Web itself, the frameworks, libraries (react, svelte...) all kind of stuff we are working in it to connect APIs to each other, the actual API itself? That's how I'm looking to web when building web application.
