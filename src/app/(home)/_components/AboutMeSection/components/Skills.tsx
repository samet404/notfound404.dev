          You might think I've listed skills that I've only used for a few
          minutes, but...
          <span className="font-bold"> NO</span>. I used at least 20 hours of
          each technology. There are even so many things I don't wanna put in
          this list and I want to learn even more things. If you don't believe
          me, I have almost 70 github repo and many projects as I described at
          the bottom. Also please, don't think I'm trying to learn everything,
          as I said before, I'm mainly focusing on Kotlin and Web ecosystem.

          Hover or click on the icons to see more information about them. Each
          border color represents its type. You can see how much I know about
          each skill by the skill level and its opacity.
