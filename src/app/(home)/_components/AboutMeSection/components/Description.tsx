        Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my
        articles and my other content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 19-year-old self-taught fullstack{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">Kotlin</span> and
        <span className="font-bold"> Web</span> developer. While I can use so
        many languages and frameworks, I'm focusing on Kotlin Multiplatform and
        Web ecosystem. I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps, backend
        services and AI applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a self-taught developer who believes in real coding experience and
        hands-on learning. I dedicate around 110 hours per week (sometimes even
        more and people think I'm a robot or something) to coding and expanding
        my technical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to learn new things, listening music, playing games, reading
        things, drawing and so on. I'm always open to new opportunities and
        collaborations. If you want to contact me, you can always find my social
        media accounts and email listed above.
