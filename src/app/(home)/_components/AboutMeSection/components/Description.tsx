        Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my
        articles and my other content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 19-year-old self-taught fullstack{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">Kotlin</span> and
        <span className="font-bold"> Web</span> developer. While I can use so
        many languages and frameworks, I'm focusing on Kotlin Multiplatform and
        Web ecosystem. I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps, backend
        services and AI applications.

       I'm a self-taught developer who believes in real coding experience and hands-on learning. I believe that real learning comes from understanding what you are actually doing. It’s not about the tools you use; it’s about understanding the math and the methods you are applying behind them.

      </p>
      <p>
        I like to learn new things, listening music, playing games, reading
        things, drawing and so on. I'm always open to new opportunities and
        collaborations. If you want to contact me, you can always find my social
        media accounts and email listed above.
