        Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my
        articles and my other content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 19-year-old self-taught fullstack{' '}
        <span className="font-bold">Kotlin</span> and
        <span className="font-bold"> Web</span> developer. While I can use so
        many languages and frameworks, I'm focusing on Kotlin Multiplatform and
        Web ecosystem. I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps, backend
        services applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I really enjoy learning low-level technologies such as the
        C programming language, compilers, graphics APIs, and 3D rendering
        libraries. However, I don't use these technologies to make money and I am not currently an expert in these; I
        genuinely enjoy learning them. For me, coding isn't just about making
        money, I am always curious about the technical and scientific aspects of programming.

        I'm a self-taught developer who believes in real coding experience and
        hands-on learning. I believe that real learning comes from understanding
        what you are actually doing. It’s not about the tools you use; it’s
        about understanding the math and the methods you are applying behind
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to learn new things, listening music, playing games, reading
        things, drawing and so on. I'm always open to new opportunities and
        collaborations. If you want to contact me, you can always find my social
        media accounts and email listed above.
